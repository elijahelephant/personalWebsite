## Technologies Used
- HTML

## Organization
- `index.html` holds all of the HTML code and structure of the page.
- `mediaqueries.css` and `style.css` contain style choices and help the web page adapt to different devices and screen sizes.
- The `assets` folder contains all images used and my resume.
- `script.js` toggles the "open" class on the HTML elements representing the mobile menu and icon, enabling the opening and closing of the mobile menu when called, typically for responsive web design.
